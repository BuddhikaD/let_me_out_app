Still, one application didn't get some functions all we need to install another app to fulfil the requirement then face the challenge, and we build all in one application.

## Technical details

This project uses Flutter as the Main Programming Language.Flutter is often compared to a more mature cross-platform React Native framework. Performance is one of the criteria that Flutter beats by far. Flutter's engine is designed to communicate directly with native modules, resulting in good performance and high speed we use Firebase. It is a NoSQL Type Document Architecture Database. The Reason why we Choose Firebase over MySQL is the Large Number of Objects and Data Classed we have Used in the Project.
